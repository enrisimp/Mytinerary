// Here is an enhanced and improved version of the 'Logo' function:

/**
 * Renders a logo with the text "MYTINERARY" and an image.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The logo component.
 */
const Logo = () => {
  return (
    <section className="flex justify-center items-center h-full">
      <h1 className="font-semibold text-2xl text-white">MYTINERARY</h1>
      <img className="h-6 mx-4" src="./logoBlue" alt="logoBlue" />
    </section>
  );
};

export default Logo;
`
Explanation:
- Added a docstring to provide a brief description of the function.
- Removed the unnecessary comment about code analysis.
- Added a return type annotation to indicate that the function returns a JSX element.
- Exported the `Logo` component as the default export of the module.;

The functionality of the `Logo` component remains the same, but the code is now more readable and understandable with the added enhancements.`
